# Weather Forecast App With React

Challenge completed! (https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv)

Demo link: https://weather-app-w1that.vercel.app/

Because of CORS problem of the API I used while doing project, you must enable the CORS solver(?) from this link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ . Or you may want to check the app without dynamic data here: https://weather-app-w1that.vercel.app/app-w-fake-data
